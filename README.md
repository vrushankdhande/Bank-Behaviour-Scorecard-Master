# Bank-behaviour-scorecard-master
This is banking project made in using machine learning alogrithm. 

Project Description which was provided was given:
A bank has given data of userâ€™s bank wants you to make a model that can be used to predict customer defaulter on his EMI payment.

This project was to predict the risk while doing the transection of crediting amount from the bank account.

The dataset was provided. the dataset contain columns and there description. There was test and train dataset provided to us. all the preprocessing was done using pandas and the data cleaning also(removing all blank cells,etc). the data visusisation was also seen to check the representation of dataset.

MODEL:
The model which i used are Dession Trees, LogisticRegression and Hyperparameter tuning. By trying this i came to analysis that Hyperparameter tuning has better accuray then others.
